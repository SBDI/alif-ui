Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It has two major branches: differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves) and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under curves).

Key concepts include limits, derivatives, and integrals. Limits describe the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain value. Derivatives represent the rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. Integrals represent the accumulation of quantities and can be used to calculate areas and volumes.

These concepts have numerous applications in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields.`;

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### Definition of a Limit
A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain value. Formally, we write:
\`\`\`
lim(x→a) f(x) = L
\`\`\`
This means that as x gets closer and closer to a, f(x) gets closer and closer to L.

### Properties of Limits
- Sum rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) + g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) + lim(x→a) g(x)
- Product rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) × g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) × lim(x→a) g(x)
- Quotient rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) / g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) / lim(x→a) g(x), provided lim(x→a) g(x) ≠ 0

### Continuity and Discontinuity
A function f is continuous at a point a if:
1. f(a) is defined
2. lim(x→a) f(x) exists
3. lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a)

Types of discontinuities:
- Removable discontinuity
- Jump discontinuity
- Infinite discontinuity

## 2. Derivatives

### Definition of a Derivative
The derivative of a function f with respect to x is defined as:
\`\`\`
f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h
\`\`\`
It represents the rate of change of the function at a given point.

### Rules for Differentiation
- Power rule: d/dx [x^n] = n × x^(n-1)
- Sum rule: d/dx [f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
- Product rule: d/dx [f(x) × g(x)] = f'(x) × g(x) + f(x) × g'(x)
- Quotient rule: d/dx [f(x) / g(x)] = [f'(x) × g(x) - f(x) × g'(x)] / [g(x)]^2
- Chain rule: d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) × g'(x)

### Applications of Derivatives
- Finding slopes of tangent lines
- Rate of change problems
- Optimization (finding maxima and minima)
- Related rates
- Curve sketching

## 3. Integrals

### Definite and Indefinite Integrals
- Indefinite integral: ∫ f(x) dx = F(x) + C, where F'(x) = f(x)
- Definite integral: ∫(a to b) f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a), where F'(x) = f(x)

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
1. If f is continuous on [a, b], then the function F defined by F(x) = ∫(a to x) f(t) dt is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), and F'(x) = f(x).
2. If f is continuous on [a, b] and F is any antiderivative of f on [a, b], then ∫(a to b) f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a).

### Integration Techniques
- Basic integrals
- Integration by substitution
- Integration by parts
- Partial fractions
- Trigonometric substitution

## 4. Applications

### Optimization Problems
Finding maximum or minimum values of functions in applied contexts.

### Related Rates
Determining how the rate of change of one quantity relates to the rate of change of another quantity.

### Area and Volume Calculations
- Area between curves
- Volumes of solids of revolution
- Volumes of solids with known cross-sections`;
